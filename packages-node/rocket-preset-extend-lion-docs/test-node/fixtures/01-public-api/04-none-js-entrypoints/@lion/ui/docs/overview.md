# Accordion

<notification-inline type="information">

Longer pages can benefit users. Accordions shorten pages and reduce scrolling, but they increase the interaction cost by requiring people to decide on topic headings.
Accordions conserve space on mobile but they can also cause disorientation and too much scrolling.
